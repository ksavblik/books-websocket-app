# Books React Application with Live Updates Support through the WebSockets

## Setup guide


__Important!__ At first make sure that you already have configured and ran the [API](https://github.com/ksavblik/rust-websocket-api).

Download or clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ksavblik/books-websocket-app
```

If you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, then it's recommended to use the lts version of Node, run in the project directory:
```sh
nvm use
```

Open the project in a terminal, install deps and run it:
```sh
cd ./books-websocket-app
yarn
yarn start
```

This is it, feel free to hack the code!ðŸ˜„
